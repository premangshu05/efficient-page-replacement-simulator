# Efficient-page-replacement-simulator
# A. Project Overview

The Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator is a software tool designed to demonstrate and analyze the working of various page replacement algorithms in an operating system. It provides users with a clear visualization of memory management, allowing them to compare the efficiency of different algorithms in handling page faults.

# B.Goals

 i.Implement and simulate FIFO, LRU, and Optimal page replacement algorithms.

 ii.Help users understand memory management and the impact of different algorithms.

 iii.Provide an interactive and user-friendly interface to input parameters and visualize results.

 iv.Generate performance reports comparing the number of page faults for each algorithm.

# C.Features

Multiple Page Replacement Algorithms: Supports FIFO, LRU, and Optimal algorithms. User Input Options: Allows users to enter the number of memory frames and reference string. Performance Comparison: Displays the number of page faults for each algorithm. Visual Representation: Shows memory allocation and page replacement process step-by-step. Scalability: Can be extended to include additional page replacement techniques (e.g., Clock Algorithm).

# D.Scope

The simulator covers the following page replacement algorithms:
1️. FIFO (First-In-First-Out): Replaces the oldest loaded page.
2️. LRU (Least Recently Used): Replaces the page that hasn’t been used for the longest time.
3️. Optimal Page Replacement: Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future.

# E. Expected Outcomes

i. A working software simulator that accurately demonstrates page replacement.

ii. Performance reports showing the number of page faults for each algorithm.

iii. Enhanced understanding of memory management through interactive learning.

# F.Future Enhancements

 Graphical Visualization: Add real-time graphical representations of memory frames. More Algorithms: Implement additional techniques like Clock Algorithm. Web-Based Interface: Develop an online version for educational use.
